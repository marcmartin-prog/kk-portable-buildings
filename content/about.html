<section class="about-text">
  <p>Our professional builders and employees are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to assessing your usage of your buildings and making expert suggestions. We don’t want our customers to break the bank on this lifelong investment, so we offer rent to own and financing options to save you money. Warranties are also extended to our customers, so you can trust us to provide the most durable and well-built buildings to you or your business.</p>
  <p>We’ve worked long and hard to build our reputation for quality, service, and customer satisfaction. It takes a special company to survive for 30 years in this day and age, and we’re happy to have had the privilege of serving southern Illinois since 1989. Our company is strong and respected because our storage building design & durability is unrivaled! We use top of the line materials every step of the way and never cut corners. Our storage building floors are the strongest in the business and will support virtually anything you can load on them. Furthermore, as long as you treat it right, you’ll get decades of use out of your portable shed!</p>
  <p>When you buy from K&K Storage Barns, you’re supporting a family owned and operated local business. We love our community and work hard to live up to the standards of excellence our customers expect. Furthermore, we’re proud to continue to be able to put people to work and support our region! It’s thanks to our wonderful customer base that we’re able to offer jobs in our region, and we appreciate that opportunity. When you buy a K&K Portable Building, you’re not lining the pockets of some big corporation. You’re putting food on the table of one of our workers. You’re keeping your tax dollars local. Ultimately, you’re investing in your community.</p>
