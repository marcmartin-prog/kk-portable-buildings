description: The Lofted Barn has two (2) lofts that are positioned where you
  want them and can store your yard ornaments, yard sale items, Christmas
  decorations, etc… The loft door actually opens so you have easier access
  above. This is the perfect storage building for bikes, mowers, and sports
  equipment of all kinds if you don’t want them in your garage. Add a shelf or
  two to make the most of your storage.
